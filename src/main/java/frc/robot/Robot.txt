Never touch Main; Don't worry about it.

Robot is what makes sure everything actually happens.
It initalizes the superstructure and OI files.
Then it sets up a chooser that assigns which auto file to run.
The Scheduler runs commands which all of the robot is, so without that,
the robot would do nothing.

The control loop from the operator OI runs in the periodic file.
