Superstructure initializes all the talons subsystems, limit switches, piston subsystems, and gyroscope

DriveTrain uses the leftDrive and rightDrive talon subsystems initialized in Superstructure to run
the two at the same time and to require commands together. Vision will be moved here as it is directly
involved with the DriveTrain and only the DriveTrain.

There are more subsystems but they are all instances of the prefabricated subsystems.
Instead of directly grouping related motor controllers and pistons together, they are all done together.
This is because the code for the majority of the robot is extremely repetitive.
Prefabricated bits of code(objects) decrease the clutter and repetition. Why have 3 files that are all the same but 
two or three symbols.
