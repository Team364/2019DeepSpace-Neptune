Nothing in this folder is to run on its own. These should be started somewhere else in the code.

Open loop and Closed loop commands for a single talon should not be put here
as one may simply create an instance of either found in the prefab commands folder.

Pistons are set using a prefabricated command as well. 
State changes are to be based off of command endings and or sensor input, so there should not be a "changeStateTo"
type of command created. 

Commands should typically be something time based. If one expects for a parameter to change while the 
intended code is running, it may be appropriate to place in a command.

The commands folder is intended to be used for very specific commands:

Elevate to Position and Rotate to Angle currently use an integer passed to them to
determine the encoder counts to set the resepective encoders to so. 

Run intake is to end on limit switch triggering so it needs to be a specific command.

Intake passive uses the state to set the grip pistons.

Stop Drive train relates to the driveTrain subsystem which is different from the prefabricated subSystems.
The WaitCommand works pretty well for adding delays. There may be better ways to do it, but it works for now.
