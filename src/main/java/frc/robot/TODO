Preface:
Programming has a history of doing stuff that seems cool or useful in the moment but this tends
to lead to Priorities being neglected and time wasted on side projects. Keeping a list such 
as this ensure that we may stay on track and complete goals in the proper order.

Today: 
--See if the message prints and how many times it does whenever the robot enters passive mode

Priorities:
--Go through simulated match and make sure states and positions act as intended
--Test how low the motor power has to be to hold the lift up while not being powered by either open or closed loop
--Record Positions for:
        a.)Hatch Level 1
        b.)Hatch Level 2
        c.)Hatch Level 3
        d.)Rocket Level 1
        e.)Rocket Level 2
        f.)Rocket Level 3
        g.)Cargo Ship Level 2
        h.)Intaking Cargo
        i.)Retract/Starting
--Test Pistons    
--Set up 2 PCMs
--Tune delays on Scoring Objects
--Test Climb Subroutine:
        a.)Time back Pistons
        b.)Time front Pistons
        c.)Tune hold Position Command
--Allow openloop to move in opposite direction of how it is bounded
--When Passive return to intake state
--Velocity Closed Loop -- use for intake and drive rampDown

Later:
--Align Subroutine
--Set up and test Drive to Vision Command
--Turn 180 button
--Rewrite Turn to Heading Command
--Write Autos
--Write Curved drive command for auto
--LEDs change colors on state indicating when the robot is ready to intake, when it is intaking, etc

Much Later:
--Try Catches
--Diagnostics for all hardware
--Writing files to flashDrive that tracks all actions during match
--Tracking feild position x and y with Gyro and encoders(Calculus)
